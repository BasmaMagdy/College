            <h4>About Us</h4>
            <p>
                is getting young people to read more news.
                Why? Most college students get their information from social media, which is inconsistent and unreliable.
                <br>That means young people are entering the real world — voting and engaging in civic discourse — without any real understanding of what's happening around them.
                <br>This is bad for our democracy.
                So we're bridging the gap between social media and traditional news consumption with daily email briefs at college campuses. 
                <br>They're brief. Succinct. And visually pleasing.
